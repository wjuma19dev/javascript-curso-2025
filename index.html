      Using <script defer src=...
      Would loading the two scripts inside <head> with the attribute defer have the same effect as having the scripts before </body>?
        Once again I assume this would slow up HTML4 browsers.
        Using <script async src=...
        If I have two scripts with async enabled
        
        Would they download at the same time?
        Or one at a time with the rest of the page?
        Does the order of scripts then become a problem? For example, one script depends on the other so if one downloads faster, the second one might not execute correctly, etc.
        Finally am I best to leave things as they are until HTML5 is more commonly used?
